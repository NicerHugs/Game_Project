// ## what happens during playerTurn function??
// - check if player is alive. if they are alive, continue. otherwise, you're done.
// - check if player is computer. if they are, the rest of their turn will be
// randomly generated based on available options.
// ### when the player is human
// - display the player's turn options as buttons with a "what do you want to
// do?" prompt. they might include: attack, poison, heal, etc.
// - if appropriate, ask the player who they want to target with that action.
// this can be a dropdown list, or maybe buttons or visual representations of
// each character that they might target.
// - perform the action.
// - check the player for a special feature that might let them have another
// action this turn, and if so, display their options again.
// - end their turn, now it's someone else's turn.

function playerTurn() {
    console.log("it's someone's turn");
}
